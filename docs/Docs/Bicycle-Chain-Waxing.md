## Waxed Chain Maintenance away from home (UPDATED)

[Stop Wasting Your CHAIN LUBE! Know the BEST Way to Apply It!](https://youtu.be/Vot15ro-fcE?si=Jcr4AM8XifbXqph6)

[Steps from Zero Friction Cycling](https://zerofrictioncycling.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lubricant-detail-review-Silca-super-secret-drip-v1.1.pdf) on use of SILCA Super Secret Drip Lube.

- Cross chain (large chain ring; large rear cassette cog)
- Shake bottle well and open tip halfway.
- Begin applying drip lube to top of rollers close to rear cog while pedalling backward. Be sure to apply at least 1 drop per roller and no more than 2 drops per roller while continuing to backpedal..
- Use fingers on top-bottom of chain to work the lube into rollers while back pedalling at least 3-4 revolutions.
- Pedal forward in the top of the cassette, pedal for at least 3-4 revolutions. The extreme chain angle opens gaps between plates to allow the lube to better work into the chain. Continue pedalling, shifting through all gears on the rear cassette at least once.
- Stop pedalling and allow Secret Chain Lube to dry for minimum 2 hours, test results show that lube is fully hardened in 24 hours. ZeroFrictionCycling found SSCL to be best dry lube EVER Tested after 8 hours drying, but would be EVEN BETTER after 24 hours!!

**Notes:** 

- Once home, follow [Waxed Chain Maintenance at Home](Bicycle-Chain-Waxing.md#waxed-chain-maintenance-at-home)
- [SILCA Super Secret Chain Lube with videos](https://silca.cc/collections/chain-lube-wax/products/silca-super-secret-chain-lube)

## Master Link

- Reuse master link for up to 5 times
- Use a new link on 6th chain install

**Note:** Replace the master link prior to the 6th time if you notice that removal or install of master link is too easy.

### Wippermann Connex Link

- [Connex link](https://www.connexchain.com/en/connectors/detail/connex-link) can be reused infinitely as the design relies on plate shape for retention as opposed to a tolerance fit.
- Chains can be easily opened and closed by hand – no tools required.
- Available for 12-, 11-, 10-, 9- and 8-speed chains (do not work with SRAM flat top chains).
- 12-, 11-, 10-speed links are expensive and similar in cost to 6 [YBN QRS links](https://moltenspeedwax.com/collections/ybn-master-links).

## Replace Chain at 0.5% wear

- Use [Shimano TL-CN-42 checker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DT01OBC?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) to measure wear. Any other tool may give false reading.

**Notes:** 

- SRAM chains with “HARDCHROME” – so Force / Red or x01  xx1 – they are the hardiest wearing chains in the world by a large margin – no other chains wear resistance matches SRAM HARDCHROME wear protection.
- SRAM flat top chains have oversize rollers so you will get a false low wear measure. 0.5 on a Flat top chains is going to be circa 0.7 on a normal 11/12 standard chain.
